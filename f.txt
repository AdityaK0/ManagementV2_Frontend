---- 

while on pagination why we call extra api call to products api when we are already calling filter
api for specific page


--- ON LOCAL SIDE BRAVE WILL BLOCLK THE SITE NAME START WITH AD BUT IN LIVE IT WONT so
IN LOCAL DONT ADD SITE WITH AD IF WANT TO USE THE BRAVE IN LOCAL
    


----- 

Need to implement subdomain kind of thing after all work done 
so that it could look like own property kind of thing



-- ADD & FIX 

Add <- back kind of button in portfolio product detail view page 

FIX <- On homepage the portfolio api includes portfolio details which includes the about and contact still why
      when go to the contact and about it calls the portfolio api again

CONFUSE <- we have one best option is to pass the encoded data in in the product card so we can save the
           api call and if someone miss behaves with the product url like the encoded data in data param then only call the api 
           for specific product 

another way which i currently we have is the heap map in memory data but here
the cons is when the page gets refreshed then it call the api to get that partiular product and in 
above encode and decode idea even if you refresh you still get the data only call when someone misbehaves with url
but may be then we have to deal with the SEO issue but SEO reads title and all right then i think we can update that up 
from the decoded product data also
